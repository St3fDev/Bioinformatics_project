The project regards the discovery of disease subtypes using a multi-omics dataset coming from TCGA. The dataset is the Prostate adenocarcinoma dataset (disease code “PRAD”). We will consider as disease subtypes the ones identified in a work performed by The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network [1], where they used an integrative clustering model (called iCluster [2]) on multi-omics data (somatic copy-number alterations, methylation, mRNA, microRNA, and protein levels) and discovered three disease subtypes.
